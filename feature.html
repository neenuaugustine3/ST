     The ancient Ettumanoor Mahadeva Temple is a revered shrine nestled in the heart of Kottayam, Kerala. This sacred abode of Lord Shiva has not only brought glory and fame to the region but also weaves together myths and legends that echo through centuries.

According to ancient lore, the Pandavas and the sage Vyasa themselves worshipped at this hallowed temple, sanctifying its grounds with their devotion. However, one of the most captivating tales surrounding Ettumanoor Mahadeva Temple revolves around its cherished treasures - the Ezhara Ponnana, or the seven and a half golden elephants.

These magnificent statuettes, crafted from jackfruit tree wood and adorned with approximately 13 kg of gold plates, are a testament to the temple's storied past. Legend has it that these exquisite elephants were gifted to the temple by Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the illustrious founder of the Travancore kingdom. The offering, steeped in history, is believed to have been fulfilled during the reign of his successor, Maharaja Karthika Thirunal.

The annual highlight of the temple's festivities is the Ezhara Ponnana Darshan, a mesmerizing spectacle held on the eighth day of the ten-day festival. As midnight descends, a ceremonial procession commences, carrying these precious elephants in all their golden splendor. The statuettes, varying in size but collectively known as the Ezhara seven-and-a-half Ponnana, are revered symbols of prosperity and divine blessings.

During the darshan, devotees gather in reverence at the Asthana Mandapam to behold these sacred treasures up close, their hearts filled with faith and awe. The ritual not only honours the temple's rich heritage but also invites all who witness it to partake in the spiritual legacy of Ettumanoor Mahadeva Temple.

Beyond its legends and festivities, the temple offers a serene retreat for spiritual seekers and history enthusiasts alike. Its architectural elegance and tranquil surroundings provide a sanctuary where ancient wisdom meets contemporary devotion, inviting visitors to immerse themselves in Kerala's cultural tapestry.
