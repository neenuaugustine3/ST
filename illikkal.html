Perched about 3,500 feet above sea level in the Western Ghats, Illikkal Kallu is a massive rock formation that sits majestically on the edge of the hill, offering panoramic views of the surrounding valleys, distant hills, and lush green plantations. The name ‘Illikkal Kallu’ literally means ‘Illikkal Rock,’ and it’s famous for its unique split structure — a huge granite boulder that appears as if it’s been sliced in half, balanced precariously on the peak. The trek to Illikkal Kallu is a thrilling experience in itself, with winding trails through tea estates, rolling meadows, and cool mountain air that refreshes both the body and mind. On clear days, visitors are rewarded with breathtaking views that stretch all the way to the Arabian Sea, while misty mornings wrap the hilltop in a magical blanket of clouds. Legends and myths add an air of mystery to Illikkal Kallu — locals speak of supernatural tales and hidden treasures, adding to the place’s allure. It’s also a favorite spot for photographers, thanks to its dramatic cliffs, changing light, and spectacular sunsets. Sitting on the edge, feeling the wind rush past, and gazing at the endless horizon makes Illikkal Kallu a must-visit gem for anyone exploring Kottayam’s natural wonders. Beyond its beauty, the area around Illikkal Kallu is dotted with small tea shops and local farms, giving visitors a taste of rural mountain life. Whether you’re an adventure enthusiast, a nature lover, or simply someone seeking a peaceful escape into the clouds, Illikkal Kallu promises an unforgettable experience that perfectly showcases the raw, untamed beauty of Kerala’s highlands.
